# Marketplace Implementation Test Guide

## Testing the Fixed Filters

1. **Start the development server:**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Marketplace:**
   - Go to `/marketplace`
   - Switch to the "All Products" tab

3. **Test Category Filter:**
   - Select "Pottery" from the Category dropdown
   - Verify that only pottery products are displayed
   - Check that the product count updates correctly

4. **Test Governorate Filter:**
   - Select "Cairo" from the Governorate dropdown
   - Verify that only products from Cairo locations are shown
   - Try combining with category filter

5. **Test Search:**
   - Type "vase" in the search box
   - Verify that products matching the search term appear
   - Test with partial matches

6. **Test Price Range:**
   - Adjust the price slider
   - Verify that products outside the range are filtered out

## Testing the Product Detail Page

1. **Click on any product card**
   - Should navigate to `/marketplace/product/{id}`
   - Should display full product information

2. **Verify Product Detail Features:**
   - High-resolution image display
   - Product name, price, and description
   - Rating and review count
   - Add to Cart and Add to Favorites buttons
   - Product variations (if available)
   - Artisan and location information
   - Back to Marketplace button

3. **Test Error Handling:**
   - Try accessing `/marketplace/product/invalid-id`
   - Should show "Product Not Found" message

## Expected Behavior

- **Filters work dynamically:** Products update immediately when filters change
- **No more error pages:** Clicking products leads to proper detail pages
- **Backend integration:** Filters send requests to `/api/marketplace/products`
- **Proper error messages:** "No products found in this category/location" when no matches
